## Hey there! ðŸ‘‹

I've been fascinated by test automation since 2021. There's something really enjoyable about coding in Java and tackling tricky problems. I'm all about growing and learning new things, and you can see some of the code I've written on my journey in automation below.

Feel free to take a look around and see what I've been up to. Every piece of code here tells a story of my learning curve and my excitement for this ever-evolving field!
